            <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each. The aim is to score runs by hitting
                a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot diamond.
                Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to stop
                them from scoring runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop
                at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's hit or other means. The teams switch between batting
                and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an
                inning and nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.</p>

            <p>Golf is a precision club and ball sport, in which competing players (or golfers) use many types of clubs to hit
                balls into a series of holes on a golf course using the fewest number of strokes. It is one of the few ball
                games that does not require a standardized playing area. Instead, the game is played on golf courses, each
                of which features a unique design, although courses typically consist of either nine or 18 holes. Golf is
                defined, in the rules of golf, as playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke
                or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules.</p>

            <p>Swimming has been recorded since prehistoric times; the earliest recording of swimming dates back to Stone Age
                paintings from around 7,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC. Some of the earliest references
                to swimming include the Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible, Beowulf, and other sagas. In 1578,
                Nikolaus Wynmann, a German professor of languages, wrote the first swimming book, The Swimmer or A Dialogue
                on the Art of Swimming. Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using breaststroke.</p>
